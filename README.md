# NBA Analysis
"Hey you're tall, you should be good at basketball right?"

I'm sure that many tall people have heard this at least once in their lives. Usually,
the response is that they either haven't played enough to know, or laugh it off, or some may
say that height has nothing to do with basketball skill.

It's a well known fact that human height is a normal distribution. But how does height
compare to a basketball player's ability to score? This is the question that I would like to
analyze and solve using the NBA's publicly available API.
